# Developing in assembly on the Raspberry Pi Pico

I started these notes to try and chronical learning to write code in assembly on the Pico, assuming it was a little Raspberry Pi.

Turns out it's not that at all - there's a lot more to it. So I took a step back to first learn about programming in ARM on the regular Raspberry Pi.

When/if I can find examples of ARM on the Pico I can try that project again.

Update: Turns out the Raspberry Pi folks have yet to publish details on low-level ARM type coding on the Pico. Which is why I couldn't find any.
